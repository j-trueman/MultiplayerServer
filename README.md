## **_WANNA HOST A BR MULTIPLAYER SERVER?_**

Well then this is the README for you... not that it's particularly difficult or anything, I just thought it would be helpful. So, wihtout further ado:

## Step 1: Donwload

There are two ways you can download this project. Either download it as a precompiled binary from the [releases](https://github.com/j-trueman/MultiplayerServer/releases) tab OR just download it as the plain project files. Both will achieve the same ouput but downloading asa project will allow you to updaet the code of the server to your liking.

Make sure you also download the corrseponding `dll` (Windows) or `so` (Linux) file in order to be able to succesfully connect to the databases. Place these at the path specified by the server console. If you are running on a personal machine you may need to port forward port 2095 in order for people to be able to connect.

## Step 2: Run

If you downloaded the server as a binary then it's a simple case of point and click. Once you open the exe a gray window should popup. This is the server. If you have the project files instead of an exe then you will need [Godot v4.2](https://github.com/j-trueman/MultiplayerServer/) in order to be able to run it. Once you open your server then you should be able to simply open your instance of the MultiPlayer mod and get playing. Ask your players to change their server url in their mod config menu to your public ip address.

Simple as that! Have fun!
