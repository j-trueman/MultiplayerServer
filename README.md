## **_WANNA HOST A BR MULTIPLAYER SERVER?_**

Well then this is the README for you... not that it's particularly difficult or anything, I just thought it would be helpful. So, wihtout further ado:

## Step 1: Donwload

There are two ways you can download this project. Either download it as a precompiled binary from the [releases](https://github.com/j-trueman/MultiplayerServer/releases) tab OR just download it as the plain project files. Both will achieve the same ouput but downloading asa project will allow you to updaet the code of the server to your liking.

## Step 2: Run

If you downloaded the server as a binary then it's a simple case of point and click. Once you open the exe a gray window should popup. This is the server. If you have the project files instead of an exe then you will need [Godot v4.2](https://github.com/j-trueman/MultiplayerServer/) in order to be able to run it. Once you open your server then you should be able to simply open your instance of the MultiPlayer mod and get playing.
Simple as that!
